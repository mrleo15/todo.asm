# todo.asm

## Features

- Single completely self-contained static executable (depends only on Linux x86_64 kernel);
- Includes its own simple HTTP Server listening to port 6969 (hardcoded);
- Frontend works without JavaScript (HTML forms only, like in good old days);
- XSS support in case you still want to have JavaScript on the Frontend;
